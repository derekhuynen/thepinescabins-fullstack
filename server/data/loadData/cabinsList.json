            "description": "Coyote Grove is a Mountain Chalet located in lower Moonridge, which is the premier neighborhood in Big Bear Lake. It is located on a very quiet and flat street with a straight driveway which makes accessibility easy in the winter months. Enjoy the ski slope views of Bear Mountain from the back patio. Only 2 minutes to the slopes, 5 minutes to Big Bear Village (shopping, dining, entertainment), and 5 minutes to Big Bear Lake for fishing, boating, and swimming. Relax and enjoy the Mountains!"
